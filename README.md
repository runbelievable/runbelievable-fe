# Rubelievable

## Abstract

Runbelievable is Runbelievable is an iOS app created with React Native on the frontend and Ruby/Rails on the backend to help trail runners find run buddies and trails in their area for a safer trail running experience. Upon logging into the application, a user can view a random Trail, view run buddies in their area, and chat with a buddy to confirm whether or not they'd like to meet for a run.
